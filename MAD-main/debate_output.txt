Question: As water starts to freeze, the molecules of water
Choices: text) ['gain thermal energy.', 'move more freely.', 'increase in size.', 'decrease in speed.'], label) ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

Contentiousness Level: 0.9
Tone: Highly confrontational; focused on raising strong ethical, scientific, and social objections.
Emphasis: Highlighting risks and downsides; ethical quandaries, unintended consequences, and exacerbation of inequalities.
Language: Definitive and polarizing, e.g., ``should NOT be allowed,'' ``unacceptable risks,'' ``inevitable disparities.''
