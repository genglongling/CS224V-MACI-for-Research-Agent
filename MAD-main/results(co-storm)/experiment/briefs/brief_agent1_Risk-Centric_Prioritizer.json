  "raw_brief": "# Dossier for Risk-Centric Prioritizer\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs a Risk-Centric Prioritizer, your core position in the debate on AI governance sequence is that risk assessment should be the first step. The rationale behind this position is that understanding the specific threats and potential harms posed by AI systems is crucial to inform all subsequent steps such as stakeholder consultation, regulation drafting, enforcement mechanisms, and international coordination. This dossier will provide you with a comprehensive overview of your position, supporting arguments with evidence, anticipated counter-arguments and rebuttals, acknowledgment of weaknesses, probing questions for opponents, and a recommended debate strategy.\n\n## 1. Theoretical Foundation of the Risk-Centric Position\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Precautionary Principle**: This principle suggests that action should be taken to prevent harm when it is within our power to do so, even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. Starting with risk assessment aligns with this principle as it seeks to prevent harm by identifying risks early.\n\n- **Informed Decision Making**: Effective governance requires data-driven decisions. Risk assessment provides the necessary data to make informed policy decisions.\n\n- **Tailored Regulation**: Understanding the specific nature and magnitude of risks ensures that regulations are not one-size-fits-all but are instead tailored to address the most pressing issues.\n\n### Theoretical Support\n\n- **Risk Management Theory**: This theory emphasizes identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks. It is widely used in fields like finance, healthcare, and engineering to prevent adverse outcomes.\n\n- **Systems Theory**: Viewing AI as complex systems that interact with other societal systems, understanding risks allows stakeholders to predict and mitigate negative systemic interactions.\n\n## 2. Supporting Arguments\n\n### Argument 1: Identification of Specific Threats\n\n- **Evidence**: Studies in areas like autonomous weapons or AI bias highlight specific risks that are not immediately obvious without thorough risk assessment. For example, a 2020 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology identified systemic biases in facial recognition technologies, which were only apparent after specific risk assessments were conducted.\n\n- **Historical Analogy**: The Chernobyl disaster serves as an analogy where lack of risk assessment led to catastrophic outcomes. Had risks been properly assessed and mitigated, the disaster might have been avoided.\n\n### Argument 2: Foundation for Stakeholder Consultation\n\n- **Concrete Example**: In the financial sector, Basel III regulations were informed by risk assessments which then guided stakeholder consultations. This led to more robust and effective regulatory frameworks.\n\n- **Empirical Data**: Research from the World Economic Forum indicates that well-informed stakeholder consultations, grounded on clear risk assessment data, result in more effective and accepted regulations.\n\n### Argument 3: Prioritization of Resources\n\n- **Case Study**: The European Union's approach to data protection (GDPR) involved extensive risk assessments which prioritized sectors and systems requiring the most oversight, ensuring efficient use of resources.\n\n- **Supporting Data**: A McKinsey report shows that initial risk assessments in project planning increase efficiency and effectiveness by up to 30%.\n\n## 3. Anticipated Counter-Arguments and Rebuttals\n\n### Counter-Argument 1: Delays in Urgent Regulation\n\n- **Opponent's Claim**: Starting with risk assessments can delay the implementation of necessary regulations, leaving gaps open for harm.\n\n- **Rebuttal**: While initial risk assessments may take time, they ultimately streamline the regulatory process by ensuring that regulations are targeted and effective, reducing the need for constant revisions and amendments.\n\n### Counter-Argument 2: Incomplete Risk Identification\n\n- **Opponent's Claim**: Risk assessments might not capture all potential harms, leading to incomplete regulatory frameworks.\n\n- **Rebuttal**: Risk assessment is an iterative process. Initial assessments provide a baseline, which can be updated and refined as more data becomes available. This continuous improvement approach is more effective than rushing into regulation.\n\n### Counter-Argument 3: Stakeholder Bias\n\n- **Opponent's Claim**: Risk assessments might reflect the biases of those conducting them, leading to skewed outcomes.\n\n- **Rebuttal**: Diverse and multidisciplinary teams conducting risk assessments can mitigate bias. Furthermore, transparency in the risk assessment process allows for review and correction of potential biases.\n\n## 4. Genuine Weaknesses or Edge Cases\n\n### Weakness 1: Dynamic Nature of AI\n\n- **Acknowledgment**: AI technology evolves rapidly, potentially outpacing initial risk assessments.\n\n- **Reframe**: Emphasize the importance of continuous risk assessment as part of a dynamic and adaptive governance framework.\n\n### Weakness 2: Resource-Intensive Process\n\n- **Acknowledgment**: Comprehensive risk assessments can be resource-intensive.\n\n- **Reframe**: Position risk assessment as a cost-effective investment that prevents more significant costs and harms down the line.\n\n## 5. Probing Questions for Opponents\n\n- Can you provide examples of effective regulation that were not based on initial risk assessments?\n- How would you ensure that stakeholder consultations are effective without a clear understanding of"
