  "raw_brief": "# DOSSIER: AI GOVERNANCE IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE\n## Agent: Global Harmonizer\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Global Harmonizer advocates for prioritizing international coordination as the foundational step in AI governance implementation. This position rests on the premise that AI's inherently global nature—spanning data flows, supply chains, and deployment—requires coordinated international frameworks before effective national regulations can be established. This approach aims to prevent regulatory fragmentation, ensure consistent global standards, and maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing cross-border risks.\n\n---\n\n## 1. THEORETICAL FOUNDATION AND CORE POSITION\n\n### Primary Argument Structure\n\nThe Global Harmonizer's position is built on three foundational pillars:\n\n**1. Technological Borderlessness**\n- AI systems operate across jurisdictions through cloud computing, data processing, and algorithmic deployment\n- Training data often originates from multiple countries, creating inherent international dependencies\n- AI models developed in one jurisdiction are frequently deployed globally\n\n**2. Regulatory Network Effects**\n- Early international coordination creates positive spillover effects for subsequent national implementations\n- Harmonized standards reduce compliance costs for multinational AI developers\n- Consistent frameworks enable better cross-border enforcement and cooperation\n\n**3. First-Mover Advantage in Standard-Setting**\n- International frameworks established early become templates for national legislation\n- Global coordination prevents the emergence of incompatible regulatory silos\n- Unified approaches strengthen collective bargaining power against dominant tech platforms\n\n### Theoretical Grounding\n\nThis position draws from several academic frameworks:\n\n- **Regime Theory**: International coordination creates stable expectations and reduces transaction costs in global AI governance\n- **Network Governance**: AI governance benefits from polycentric approaches that coordinate multiple stakeholders across jurisdictions\n- **Regulatory Competition Theory**: Without coordination, countries may engage in \"race to the bottom\" dynamics to attract AI investment\n\n---\n\n## 2. DEEP SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS WITH EVIDENCE\n\n### 2.1 Historical Precedents for International-First Approaches\n\n**Aviation Safety Standards**\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established global aviation safety standards before national implementations, creating the foundation for safe international air travel. Similarly, AI governance requires consistent global standards for cross-border AI systems.\n\n**Internet Governance Success Stories**\n- The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created technical standards that enabled global internet interoperability\n- Domain Name System (DNS) coordination through ICANN prevented fragmentation of the global internet\n- These examples demonstrate how early international coordination can enable rather than constrain innovation\n\n**Environmental Precedents**\n- The Montreal Protocol's success in addressing ozone depletion began with international coordination before national implementation\n- The protocol's phase-down approach provides a model for gradual AI governance implementation\n- Early international agreement enabled coordinated research and technology sharing\n\n### 2.2 Current AI Landscape Evidence\n\n**Cross-Border AI Dependencies**\n- Major AI models (GPT, BERT, etc.) are trained on globally sourced data and deployed internationally\n- AI supply chains span multiple jurisdictions: chip manufacturing (Taiwan, South Korea), software development (US, China, EU), deployment (global)\n- Cloud computing infrastructure enables AI systems to process data across borders instantaneously\n\n**Existing Fragmentation Costs**\n- GDPR compliance costs for AI systems average $1.3 million per company according to Cisco's 2023 Privacy Benchmark Study\n- Different privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA) create compliance complexity for AI developers\n- Divergent AI regulations in China, EU, and US are already creating market fragmentation\n\n**International Cooperation Momentum**\n- G7 AI Governance Principles (2023) demonstrate appetite for international coordination\n- UN AI Advisory Body and Global Partnership on AI show institutional infrastructure exists\n- OECD AI Principles (2019) achieved consensus among 46 countries, proving feasibility\n\n### 2.3 Economic and Innovation Benefits\n\n**Reduced Compliance Costs**\n- Harmonized standards eliminate need for multiple compliance frameworks\n- Shared certification processes reduce barriers to entry for smaller AI developers\n- Consistent liability frameworks enable clearer risk assessment and insurance markets\n\n**Enhanced Innovation Through Coordination**\n- Shared research initiatives can pool resources for AI safety research\n- Common standards enable interoperability and faster technology diffusion\n- Coordinated approaches to AI talent mobility can address global skills shortages\n\n**Market Efficiency Arguments**\n- Prevents regulatory arbitrage that could concentrate AI development in permissive jurisdictions\n- Creates larger, unified markets that can support more AI innovation\n- Enables better coordination of public AI investments and research priorities\n\n---\n\n## 3."
